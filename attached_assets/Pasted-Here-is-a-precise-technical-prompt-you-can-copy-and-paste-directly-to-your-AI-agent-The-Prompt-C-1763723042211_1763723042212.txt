Here is a precise, technical prompt you can copy and paste directly to your AI agent.
The Prompt
> Context: Act as an expert frontend developer. Redesign my invoice generator template to match the attached reference image exactly.
> Global Constraints:
>  * Canvas Size: The output invoice must have fixed dimensions of 70cm width by 50cm height (Landscape). Use @media print rules to enforce this size.
>  * Font: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica, Arial, or Roboto).
> Layout Specifications:
>  * Header Section:
>    * Left: Display "INVOICE BLH#..." and "DATE:..." aligned to the left.
>    * Right (Logo): Create a logo container that is exactly 660px wide by 380px tall. Ensure the logo image uses object-fit: contain to fill this space perfectly without distortion.
>  * Divider: Place a thick, bright green solid border-bottom or <hr> immediately below the header section.
>  * Body:
>    * Render the heading "DELIVERY DETAILS" immediately below the green divider line.
>    * Style: Centered, Large, Bold, Uppercase, with significant letter spacing.
>  * Footer:
>    * Use Flexbox to push the footer content ("Thank you for shopping..." and the asterisks line) to the absolute bottom of the 50cm height, maximizing the whitespace in the middle for the delivery details.

Technical Breakdown (For your knowledge)
Here is the math used to determine the pixel dimensions you asked for in point #1, based on your 70cm x 50cm paper size requirement.
1. The Brand Logo Dimensions
To fill that red square area proportionally on a 70cm wide canvas, I calculated the pixels using standard CSS print resolution (96 DPI) combined with the visual aspect ratio of your reference image.
 * Canvas Width: 70\text{ cm} \approx 2645\text{ px}
 * Canvas Height: 50\text{ cm} \approx 1890\text{ px}
 * Logo Area: Visually, the logo takes up roughly 25% of the width and 20% of the height.
   * Exact Dimensions for Prompt: 660\text{ px} \times 380\text{ px}
2. Why the "Green Line" placement matters
By instructing the agent to place the heading immediately below the border/divider, we ensure the "DELIVERY DETAILS" text anchors to the top section, preventing it from floating into the middle of the page.
3. Dragging the bottom down
The prompt uses the instruction "push to the absolute bottom." In CSS terms, this usually triggers the agent to use margin-top: auto (in a flex container) or position: absolute; bottom: 0;, which forces that footer specifically to the edge of your 50cm paper.
